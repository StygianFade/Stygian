# Contributor Attribution and AI Transparency Policy

This project publishes contributor attribution and AI usage transparently for public readers.

This is a documentation attribution policy. It does not rewrite git history.

## Contributors

- `Ky`, `Night`, `Kath`, and `Sol` are contributors to this project.

## Work Attribution

- `Sol`: originated Stygian, wrote the initial codebase, and led TRIAD
  compression work; redirected delivery focus to SGC while TRIAD research
  continues.
- `Night`: backend systems and SoA direction contribution.
- `Ky`: core runtime and non-backend systems, including DoD direction.
- `Kath`: documentation and tests.

## AI Assistance Disclosure

- AI assistants used: Claude 4, GPT-5, Gemini 3.
- AI was used for iteration support, testing support, documentation drafting, and research acceleration.
- Project scope, timeline, cost, and feasibility would not have been practical without AI assistance.

## Human Ownership

- Final technical decisions, integration choices, and acceptance stayed with human contributors.

## Project Status and Maintenance

- Stygian is in its infancy and remains a work in progress.
- Performance may not always meet expectations across all workloads and hardware.
- Stygian is MIT-licensed and provided as-is, without warranty.
- Central repo maintenance is limited, and updates are expected to be occasional.
- The primary focus is applying Stygian in real projects (an IDE, a game
  engine, a web browser, and other tools), then upstreaming improvements when
  possible.
- If other contributors are interested in partnering or co-maintaining, collaboration is welcome.

## Additional Contributors

- Additional contributors participated and requested to remain unnamed.
