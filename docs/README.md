# Stygian Documentation

This folder is the canonical home for active Stygian documentation.

## Layout

- `architecture/` - Runtime model, DDI contracts, data layout decisions.
- `reference/` - Public API reference and contracts (`core/`, `cmd/`, `ap/`).
- `guides/` - How-to guides (`integration/`, `migration/`).
- `perf/` - Performance docs (`gates/`, `profiling/`, `hardware-notes/`).
- `governance/` - Coding rules, review checklists, release policy.
- `context/` - Legacy/context docs preserved for historical and research context.

## Writing Rules

- New docs go in one of the five active sections above.
- Keep historical research and superseded plans in `context/`.
- Link from this index whenever adding a new top-level doc.
